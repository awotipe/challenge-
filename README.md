My process
Built with
HTML5 markup

CSS Grid -desktop-first workflow

What I learned
in this challange i learned how to use the css grid and adding implicit rows and columns makes your layout easy because you don't have to adjust the width and the height for your grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows. it will be automatically adusted based on your content it will avoid uneccessary width and height for your content.

Continued development
for the future the project i will focuss on doing projects which make better my skills to use flexbox and grid and also responsive design.
